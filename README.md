# 🖥️ Computer Service Company Website

Welcome to the **Computer Service Company Website**, a dynamic and modern company profile built during my Erasmus internship in Fuerteventura. This project showcases my ability to create professional and high-performing websites using the latest web technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB.

## ✨ Overview

This website serves as a digital business card for a computer service company. It was developed using **Next.js** with **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for enhanced performance and SEO. The site is styled with **SCSS** to ensure modular and maintainable code. **MongoDB** is used for managing service requests, and the project is fully written in **TypeScript** to ensure type safety across the codebase.

### Key Features:
- **💻 Service Overview**: A comprehensive description of the company's services, including computer repairs, diagnostics, and electronics servicing.
- **📞 Contact Form**: A user-friendly form for customers to request service appointments or ask questions.
- **📍 Location and Hours**: Clear details about the company's physical location and business hours.
- **🔄 State Management**: The **Context API** is used to efficiently manage global state, such as user inquiries and service requests.
- **📈 SEO Optimization**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) helps boost search engine visibility and improve loading times.
